# Pyroject v0.1

#### Description
Developed out of necessity to track personal projects. Needed a way to quickly add notes and todo's related to a variety of projects.
Has a way to track costs of projects. In the future it will have todo stats, cost stats and sums of projects etc. Was also thinking of zipping your projects directory, and encrypting the file with a key. On open it decrypts the zip with your key and extracts the project directory. This way you can store your projects in Github, as long as your gitignore ignores the token.key file.
```
python3 main.py
```
